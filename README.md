# Project-Investigate-a-Dataset--Gapminder-world
In this project, I went through the data analysis process, using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.  the data analysis process is performed on a dataset joined from multiple, related  datasets gathered  from the gapminder world.
the project is implemented on a jupyter notebook, a save of this notebook is uploaded here as a .ipynb named "Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb", which contains the code, explanations of the code, visualization, and the reached conclusion. and a .html file named "Investigate_a_Dataset.html" is also uploaded, as well as all the datasets used, which are uploaded as a .csv files.
