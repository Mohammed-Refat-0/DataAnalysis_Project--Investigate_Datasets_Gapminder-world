# Data-Analysis Project--Investigate Datasets from Gapminder world
## Description
In this project, I went through the data analysis process, including wrangling, cleaning, merging, analyzing, and visualizing multiple datasets obtained from Gapminder world using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib in jupter notebook, to try and answer the question of: <mark> for a certain year, is their any relationship between GDP per capita (dependent variable) and population trends (total population, population density and annual population growth, independent variables) and if there is, which independent variable is the most correlated to the dependent variable and is there any correlation between the independent variables. </mark>
## Data source and files
Data sources:\
all the used datasets are obtained from Gapminder world, which are:\
[gdppercapita_us_inflation_adjusted.csv](https://github.com/Mohammed-Refat-0/Project-Investigate-a-Dataset--Gapminder-world/blob/main/gdppercapita_us_inflation_adjusted.csv): : it contains a column for country name and multiple columns for the GDP per capita for the years 1960-2020\
[population_total.csv](https://github.com/Mohammed-Refat-0/Project-Investigate-a-Dataset--Gapminder-world/blob/main/population_total.csv): it contains a column for country name and multiple columns for the total population for the years 1800-2100\
[population_growth_annual_percent.csv](https://github.com/Mohammed-Refat-0/Project-Investigate-a-Dataset--Gapminder-world/blob/main/population_growth_annual_percent.csv): it contains a column for country name and multiple columns for the population density for the years 1950-2100\
[population_growth_annual_percent.csv](https://github.com/Mohammed-Refat-0/Project-Investigate-a-Dataset--Gapminder-world/blob/main/population_growth_annual_percent.csv):  it contains a column for country name and multiple columns for the population growth rate from 1961-2020\
Files:
the project is implemented on a jupyter noteok, a save of this notebook is uploaded here as a .ipynb named "Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb", which contains the code, explanations of the code, visualization, and the reached conclusion. and a .html file named "Investigate_a_Dataset.html" is also uploaded, as well as all the datasets used, which are uploaded as a .csv files.
